## Overview
Scrabble is a classic board game where players use letter tiles to create words on a game board. Each letter has a point value, and the goal is to create words with high point values. The game ends when one player has used all of their tiles, or when no more words can be created.

In this implementation, players take turns to place tiles on the board and create words. Each turn, the player can either place tiles on the board or exchange some of their tiles for new ones. The game ends when one player has used all of their tiles, or when no more words can be created.

In host mode, the game can accommodate up to four players, with at least one local player acting as the host. The other players can be either local or remote. In guest mode, the game can only accommodate one player who can connect to a host.

### Built With


## Architecture

### Server-Side
The project utilizes a client-server architecture and makes use of design patterns, as well as generic collections and data structures for optimized runtime performance. The server-side algorithms implemented include LRU Cache, LFU Cache, and Bloom Filter to reduce redundant calculations. The project was designed according to SOLID principles, resulting in a well-structured and maintainable codebase.
